Description: Utilities for handling iCalendar data, in
  particular reading and creating/writing iCalendar files.
  The package is written in pure R, with no dependencies
  (package 'base64enc' is only needed if calendar files have
  attachments).  The package maps iCalendar dates and
  date-times to R's native 'Date' and 'POSIXct' classes.
  Recurrance rules for repeated items (such as birthdays)
  can be expanded into actual occurance sets.  Timezones are
  supported.
