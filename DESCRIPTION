Description: Utilities for handling iCalendar data, in particular
  reading and creating/writing iCalendar files.  The package is
  written in pure R, with no strict dependencies (package
  'base64enc' is only needed if calendar files have attachments).
  The package maps iCalendar dates and date-times to R's native
  'Date' and 'POSIXct' classes.  Recurring items (such as birthdays)
  can be expanded.  Timezones are supported.
