Description: Utilities for handling icalendar data. The package
             is written in pure R, with no strict dependencies
             (package 'base64enc' is only needed if calendar
             files have attachments). The package maps iCalendar
             dates and date-times to R's native 'Date' and
             'POSIXct' classes.  Recurring items can be expanded.
